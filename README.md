# Python Search-bar

REQUIREMENT
-ttkbootstrap

In windows11 the searchbar no longer redirects me to web search.
So I design a simple searchbar in Python and created a bach file placed on startapp folder (C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp) in this way my searchbar will open at bootup.

The searchbar is placed on bottom right corner with 0.5 alpha transparency and it's always on top of evey window.
You can write text and hit ENTER for redericting to your default browser on google search.
If you want to quit from application select the box and hit ESC.

I also compiled the app so you find an executable file ready to use.

Any comments or suggestions are appreciated and will be taken into consideration to improve the project
