## REQUIREMENT
python module:
-ttkbootstrap
## Introduction
In windows11 the searchbar no longer redirecting me to web search.
So I design a simple searchbar in Python and created a bach file placed on startapp folder (C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp) in this way my searchbar will open at bootup.
## Usage
The searchbar is placed on bottom right corner with 0.5 alpha transparency and it's always **on top** of evey window.
You can write text and hit **ENTER** for redericting to your default browser on google search.
If you want to quit from application select the box and hit **ESC**.
## EXE
I also compiled the app so you find an executable file ready to use.

Any comments or suggestions are appreciated and will be taken into consideration to improve the project
